when we want to upload our code to github, we just want to upload our src
so we need to exclude our binary (./my-rssagg) using .gitignore file
just specified the files that want to be excluded from the github in .gitignore

to add all the config for our project we use .env file
but we don't need to upload the .env file into github coz the PORT may be different in the prod

go mod vendor creates vendor folder
vendor is to create a local copy of our dependency project code into our project so it would still be available even after the dependency is gone from the internet
